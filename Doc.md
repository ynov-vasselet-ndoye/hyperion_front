I'll create a documentation for your project based on the available code. Here's a structured overview:

# Project Documentation

## Overview
This appears to be a Nuxt.js-based dashboard application for system monitoring, built with Vue 3 and TypeScript. The application provides real-time monitoring of system processes, services, and system metrics (CPU and Memory usage).

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Nuxt 3
- **UI Libraries**: 
  - Tailwind CSS
  - @nuxt/ui
- **Charting**: 
  - @unovis/vue
- **Date Handling**: Luxon

## Current Features

### 1. Dashboard
- Real-time system metrics visualization
  - CPU Usage graph
  - Memory Usage graph
- Services overview
- Process monitoring

### 2. Process Management
- Process listing with details:
  - PID
  - Process name
  - Status
  - CPU usage percentage
  - Memory usage percentage
- Process filtering capability
- Process termination functionality

### 3. WebSocket Integration
- Real-time data updates for processes
- Error handling with toast notifications

```

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments for components and functions
   - Create API documentation for WebSocket endpoints

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement more robust error handling in process management
   - Add error boundaries

3. **Testing**
   - No testing implementation visible in the codebase
   - Should add unit tests for components
   - Add integration tests for WebSocket functionality

4. **Features to Consider**
   - Process search optimization
   - Process grouping/categorization
   - Historical data visualization
   - System alerts/notifications
   - User authentication/authorization
   - Process resource limits management

5. **Code Organization**
   - Consider implementing a service layer
   - Add proper state management for larger scale
   - Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

6. **Performance**
   - Implement pagination for process lists
   - Add data caching strategies
   - Optimize WebSocket connections
